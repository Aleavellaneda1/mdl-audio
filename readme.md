### Motivation

Getting my music library online and I wanted a slick looking UI, one that would display album art and auto play the next song.  Thought I would share.

### Installation

:hand: PREREQUISITE: Your audio and image files must be online.  If you are serving this code via HTTPS then the audio and image files must also be retrieved via HTTPS.

Copy and Paste easy.  The easiest way to install this example is to clone or download it.  Replace my audio and image paths with your own.  Copy and paste style.
